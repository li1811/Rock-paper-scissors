# Very basic rock paper scissors game. 
<br>
I have made a game like this before but it was a very long time ago and it was also a lot more basic back then. I wanted to make something that doesn't look super ugly, 
and has some nice features like a win condition. <br> I also used event listeners which I have never used before and it's definitely a much better way of doing it than 
using browser alerts which is how I did it the first time. <br>
Even though this is very basic it's definitely the most complicated thing i have ever made, but I think the same 
can probably be achieved with a lot better code.
